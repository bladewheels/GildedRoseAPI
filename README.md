# GildedRoseAPI

## This is a Java/SpringBoot-based HTTP/REST API server for a fictitious entity, 'The Gilded Rose'.

* The requirements are: "...to produce a public HTTP-accessible API. The Gilded Rose would like to utilize a **surge pricing** model like Uber to increase the price of *items* by 10% if they have been **viewed** *more than 10 times in an hour*."
   * i.e.:
     * Retrieve the current inventory (i.e. list of items) [ ]
     * Buy an item (user must be authenticated) [ ]
     * Here is the definition for an item:
         ```C#
         class Item 
         { 
            public    String    Name {get; set;} 
            public    String    Description {get; set;} 
            public    int       Price {get; set;} 
         }
         ```

* A couple of questions to consider: 
  * How do we know if a user is *authenticated*? 
  * Is it *always possible* to buy an item? 

* Please model (and test!) accordingly. Using **a real database is not required**. 
* Deliverables:
  * A runnable system with instructions on how to build/run your application [ ]
  * The application should be built using Java and the Spring framework [X]
  * The application should be able to be run from the command line without any dependencies or databaseâ€™s required to run your application.  (Other than maven, gradle and Java) [X]
  * A system that can process the two API requests via HTTP [X]
  * Appropriate tests (unit, integration etc) [ ]
  * A quick explanation of: 
     * Your application, how you set it up, how it was built, how you designed the surge pricing and the type of architecture chosen. [ ]
     * Choice of *data format*. Include one example of a request and response. [X]
       * JSON serialization
       * See USAGE.md for example Request/Responses
     * What *authentication mechanism* was chosen, and why? [X]
       * I had never used Spring Security before but:
         * I felt it would be the most acceptable option to a team already using SpringBoot.
         * I briefly searched for the simplest possible mechanism to start with, recognising that it should be able to be made more robust later.
           * props to this blog post/author:
             * https://octoperf.com/blog/2018/03/08/securing-rest-api-spring-security/
             * https://github.com/jloisel/securing-rest-api-spring-security
         * I landed upon this approach:
           * returning a UUID token in response to a GET to a public (i.e. unauthenticated) URL
           * requiring a (UUID) token in the Authorization HTTP Header of any private URLs.


#### Some things I wondered about:
* ~~use HATEOS?~~ [Not enough time]
* ~~use JSON schemas?~~ [Not enough time]
* introduce & expose Item IDs? [X]
* /list endpoint:
  * ~~filter w/query params?~~ [Nope]
  * ~~ranges e.g. names starting with? IDs?~~ [Nope]
  * ~~pagination?~~ [Nope]
    * ~~(variable?) page size?~~ [Nope]
    * how to determine serverside *viewed* status, for each item, for the purposes of determing *surge pricing*?
      * use thread-safe LongAdder, incrementing when /inventory called
  * ~~consciously choose to return *in-stock* yes/no attribute with each item~~ [Nope]
    * ~~i.e. rather than *not* returning items that *are* out-of-stock~~
    * ~~this allows callers to parallelize their *get-all, by-page* calls *without* inadvertently missing/duplicating items that go in or out of stock during the query time~~
* /buy endpoint:
  * ~~quantity defaults to: 1~~
  * ~~return 400 if quantity > in-stock count?~~
  * how to safely (i.e. ACID) handle concurrent decrements to stock level?
    * use thread-safe LongAdder, incrementing when /inventory called
  * where (if at all) to persist buys? e.g. item, quantity, price, buyer?
    * returned Model objects (no persistence, but easily added) serialized as JSON
  * does surge pricing apply if fulfilling *part* of executing a buy request tips the items/hour *over* the threshold?
    * Nope
  * **should** items have a pre-calculated *surge price* so as to avoid onerous calculating when calling /list?
    * Nope
    * or, would /list calls **just** advertise the *normal* price?
* purchases should result in a one-line description e.g.
  * itemID totalQuantity surgeQuantity price surgePrice totalPrice
   * returned Model objects, serialized as JSON
* *surge pricing*:
  * applies to 10 times in current ~~*wallclock* hour or~~ *duration* hour?
    * likely that *last 60 minutes* is implied in **surge** terminology
  * concurrent listings of items need to be aggregated & processed by surge pricer
    * data structure for surge pricer process?
      * ~~ring buffer or dequeue or ...?~~
      * simple (unbounded) List, needs pruning...
      * needs rolling time window to determine surge
      * simplest: DB View like: COUNT(views) WHERE viewedAt >= (NOW() - 1 hour) GROUP BY ItemID
        * needs cleanup script to cull old views, @Scheduled?
   * ~~round *up* or *down* when calculating? e.g. 1.1 x 1225 = 1238 or 1237?~~
     * Math.floor()
* generate API docs from test w/Spring Docs? [ ]
* ~use H2 DB and persist to local file? [Neither]~
  * Or, just use HashMap as DB?
    * key on Item ID
  * *bootstrap* process should use *deterministic* **ItemIDs and prices** to ease integration/unit  testing
    * **names & descriptions** too?
* authorization:
  * ~~differentiate between SHOPPER and ADMINISTRATOR roles:~~
    * SHOPPERs can call /list and /buy, as above
    * ~~ADMINISTRATORs can, in addition call:~~
      * ~~/add, for adding new Items~~
      * ~~/remove, for removing Items~~
      * ~~/stock, for changing stock levels of Items in the inventory~~
