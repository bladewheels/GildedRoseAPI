# GildedRoseAPI

## This is a Java/SpringBoot-based HTTP/REST API server for a fictitious entity, 'The Gilded Rose'.

* The requirements are: to produce a public HTTP-accessible API. The Gilded Rose would like to utilize a **surge pricing** model like Uber to increase the price of *items* by 10% if they have been viewed *more than 10 times in an hour*.
   * i.e.:
     * [ ] Retrieve the current inventory (i.e. list of items)
     * [ ] Buy an item (user must be authenticated) 
     * Here is the definition for an item:
         ```C#
         class Item 
         { 
            public    String    Name {get; set;} 
            public    String    Description {get; set;} 
            public    int       Price {get; set;} 
         }
         ```

* A couple of questions to consider: 
  * How do we know if a user is *authenticated*? 
  * Is it *always possible* to buy an item? 

* Please model (and test!) accordingly. Using **a real database is not required**. 
* Deliverables:
  * [ ] A runnable system with instructions on how to build/run your application
  * [ ] The application should be built using Java and the Spring framework
  * [ ] The application should be able to be run from the command line without any dependencies or databaseâ€™s required to run your application.  (Other than maven, gradle and Java)
  * [ ] A system that can process the two API requests via HTTP 
  * [ ] Appropriate tests (unit, integration etc) 
  * A quick explanation of: 
     * [ ] Your application, how you set it up, how it was built, how you designed the surge pricing and the type of architecture chosen.
     * [ ] Choice of *data format*. Include one example of a request and response. 
     * [ ] What *authentication mechanism* was chosen, and why?

## Points to ponder:
* [ ] HATEOS?
* [ ] JSON schemas?
* introduce & expose Item IDs?
* /list endpoint:
  * filter w/query params?
  * ranges e.g. names starting with? IDs?
  * [ ] pagination?
    * (variable?) page size?
  * [ ] consciously choose to return *in-stock* yes/no attribute with each item
    * i.e. rather than *not* returning items that *are* out-of-stock
    * this allows callers to parallelize their *get-all, by-page* calls *without* inadvertently missing items that go in or out of stock during the query time
* [ ] generate API docs from test w/Spring Docs?
* [ ] use H2 DB and persist to local file? 
  * Or, just use HashMap as DB?
    * key on Item ID
